== Description ==

Monostack is a Gutenberg-ready WordPress theme that brings the beauty of code editors to the frontend. With a strong focus on typography and color, Monostack highlights specific grammar much like syntax highlighting does in code editors. Monostack is named after the "monospace" font stack used throughout the theme.

Based on [Underscores](http:underscores.me/) and the [Gutenberg Starter Theme](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-starter-theme), Monostack is designed and further developed by [Mark Uraine](https://markuraine.com/)

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does "Gutenberg-ready" mean? =

"Gutenberg-ready" is a way to indicate that this theme supports the Gutenberg plugin and the usage of blocks in the new editor. There are no sidebars in this theme and widgets are not recommended since they will all eventually be blocks anyways. Monostack takes advantage of the 100% width layout for Gutenberg blocks to work correctly.

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Monostack includes support for Infinite Scroll in Jetpack. It also works best with the Gutenberg plugin.

= Is there a problem with IE 11? =

Yes. I use CSS variables which are not supported in IE. I also use ES6 (ie. arrow functions and includes) which are also not supported in IE.
